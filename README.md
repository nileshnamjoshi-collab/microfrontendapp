# angular-microfrontends

Microfrontends built with Angular Elements and webcomponent
We will need a few dependencies to build and run Angular custom elements. Install the following dependencies inside your custom-element using following commands.

#1. ng add @angular/elements
#2. ng add ngx-build-plus

#Let us also install the http-server module inside the flight-booking project.
npm i -g http-server --save

#Start the server of your application locally run below command(s).
http-server ./dist/<folder name of app> -p <port number>

#above command is not needed if you deployed your app(s) on hosted server.
